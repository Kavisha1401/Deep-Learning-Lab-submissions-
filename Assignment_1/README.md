# Deep Learning Assignment 1 – Neural Network Basics

## Problem Statement

This assignment introduces the fundamentals of **Deep Learning** using **PyTorch**. The objective is to understand basic tensor operations, implement perceptrons, and train simple neural networks for **classification** and **regression** tasks.

## Tasks

- Perform basic **PyTorch tensor operations**
- Implement a **perceptron** to model:
  - AND gate  
  - OR gate
- Solve the **XOR problem** using a multi-layer neural network
- Implement **linear regression** using a neural network

## Objectives

- Understand limitations of linear models
- Learn how hidden layers solve non-linear problems
- Gain hands-on experience with PyTorch training workflows

## Tools Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- PyTorch

## Expected Outcome

- Perceptron solves AND/OR but fails on XOR
- Multi-layer network successfully learns XOR
- Neural network approximates linear regression accurately
